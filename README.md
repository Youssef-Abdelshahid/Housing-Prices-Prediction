# Housing Prices Prediction

This repository contains machine learning projects and reports related to predicting housing prices using various datasets and algorithms.

## Files Description

- **`Report On Housing Prices Prediction ML.pdf`**: A detailed report documenting the methodology, analysis, and results of the housing prices prediction project.
- **`housing_prices_prediction.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for housing prices prediction.
- **`train.csv`**: The dataset used for training the machine learning model, containing features related to housing properties and their corresponding prices.

## Usage

1. **Dataset**: The `train.csv` file contains the training data. Ensure it is placed in the same directory as the notebook for seamless access.
2. **Notebook**: Open `housing_prices_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to explore the code, run the analysis, or modify the model.
3. **Report**: Refer to the PDF report for insights into the project's approach, findings, and conclusions.
